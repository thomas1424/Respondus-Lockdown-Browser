# Respondus-Lockdown-Browser
This is the codebase for Respondus Lockdown Browser (Chrome extension)

I will list bypass methods in the future.

Instructions on how to load a modified lockdown browser.

1. Save the modified code, make sure that it is all contained within a folder and that manifest.json is accessible.
2. Go to chrome://extensions, or whatever your extension management page is.
3. Click Load unpacked
4. Load the modified code into extensions.
